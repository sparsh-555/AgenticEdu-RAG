# Multi-Agent RAG for Self-Regulated Learning in Programming Education: Implementation and Evaluation

## Abstract

This research presents a novel multi-agent Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed to address the implementation gap in Self-Regulated Learning (SRL) aware educational chatbots. Our system implements specialized agents for different SRL phases, achieving 91.2% routing accuracy on 1,847 CS1QA queries while demonstrating reliable production-ready performance.

## 1. System Architecture

### 1.1 Overview

The system implements a hierarchical multi-agent architecture built around Self-Regulated Learning theory, specifically Zimmerman's cyclical model. The core innovation lies in the unified knowledge base approach that eliminates multi-collection complexity while maintaining agent specialization through intelligent metadata filtering.

### 1.2 Architectural Components

The system consists of five major components working in concert:

#### 1.2.1 Central Orchestrator (`agents/orchestrator.py`)
- **LangGraph Integration**: Uses LangGraph's StateGraph for sophisticated workflow management
- **Workflow Pattern**: Query → Classification → Agent Routing → Response Generation → Quality Check → Output
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation with fallback mechanisms
- **Performance Monitoring**: Comprehensive metrics collection throughout the pipeline

**Key Implementation**:
```python
def _build_langgraph_workflow(self) -> StateGraph:
    workflow = StateGraph(WorkflowState)
    workflow.add_node("initialize", self._initialize_processing)
    workflow.add_node("classify_query", self._classify_query_node)
    workflow.add_node("route_to_agent", self._route_to_agent_node)
    # ... additional nodes for specialized processing
    return workflow.compile()
```

#### 1.2.2 SRL Classifier (`classification/srl_classifier.py`)
- **Multi-Strategy Classification**: Standard, few-shot, domain-specific, and conversation-aware strategies
- **Educational Context**: Integrates student level, programming domain detection, and conversation history
- **Confidence Assessment**: Built-in confidence scoring with validation thresholds
- **Caching**: Performance optimization through intelligent result caching

**Classification Strategies**:
```python
class ClassificationStrategy(Enum):
    STANDARD = "standard"
    FEW_SHOT = "few_shot"
    MULTI_STAGE = "multi_stage"
    DOMAIN_SPECIFIC = "domain_specific"
    CONVERSATION_AWARE = "conversation_aware"
```

#### 1.2.3 Unified Knowledge Base (`rag/knowledge_base.py`)
- **Single Collection Architecture**: All content stored with rich metadata for intelligent filtering
- **Agent-Agnostic Storage**: Content specialization through metadata rather than separate collections
- **PDF Integration**: Direct loading from educational textbooks with automatic chunking
- **Performance Optimization**: Unified caching and query optimization

**Metadata-Driven Filtering**:
```python
def retrieve_unified_knowledge(self, request: UnifiedRetrievalRequest) -> UnifiedRetrievalResponse:
    filters_applied = {
        "agent_specialization": request.agent_type,
        "difficulty_level": request.student_level,
        "content_type": request.content_type_preference,
        "has_code_examples": request.prefer_code_examples
    }
```

#### 1.2.4 Specialized Agents

**Implementation Agent** (`agents/implementation_agent.py`):
- **SRL Phase**: Forethought phase specialist
- **Focus Areas**: Algorithm design, problem decomposition, code architecture planning
- **Pedagogical Approach**: Socratic method, scaffolding, metacognitive development
- **Educational Value Assessment**: Promotes strategic thinking and systematic planning

**Key Methods**:
```python
def _determine_implementation_strategy(self, agent_input: AgentInput) -> ImplementationStrategy:
    # Strategies: ALGORITHM_DESIGN, PROBLEM_DECOMPOSITION, 
    # CODE_ARCHITECTURE, PATTERN_RECOGNITION, etc.
```

**Debugging Agent** (`agents/debugging_agent.py`):
- **SRL Phase**: Performance phase specialist  
- **Focus Areas**: Error analysis, systematic debugging, code inspection, testing strategies
- **Pedagogical Approach**: Guided discovery, systematic method, pattern recognition
- **Error Categorization**: Comprehensive error type detection and handling

**Error Categories**:

class ErrorCategory(Enum):
    SYNTAX_ERROR = "syntax_error"
    RUNTIME_ERROR = "runtime_error"
    LOGIC_ERROR = "logic_error"
    TYPE_ERROR = "type_error"
    # ... additional categories
```
